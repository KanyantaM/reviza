ReviZa is a mobile application designed to facilitate the sharing and access of past papers and other academic resources specifically for university students. This project was conceptualized in response to a significant challenge faced by the student population: the scarcity of centralized, high-quality academic resources.

<!-- truncate -->

:::note
Currently, students rely heavily on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram to share study materials. However, these platforms are not optimized for academic use and often result in disorganized and repeated sharing of files, leading to inefficiencies in accessing study resources.
:::

## **Problem Statement**

The primary problem addressed by ReviZa is the lack of streamlined, high-quality, and centralized access to study materials for Zambian university students.

:::danger
The unstructured distribution of materials across various messaging applications not only hinders efficient access but also poses challenges in revising and retaining academic information effectively.
:::

Our goal was to create a specialized platform tailored to meet the unique needs of university students in Zambia.

---

## **Market Research**

To better understand the market, we analyzed similar applications, including **Khan Academy**, **Studocu**, and **Estudy**. While each offers educational content, they fall short for Zambian students in critical ways:

:::tip

- **Khan Academy**: Excellent educational content, but lacks alignment with the Zambian university curriculum.  
- **Studocu**: Provides a wide range of materials, but the absence of Zambian syllabus alignment reduces its relevance.  
- **Estudy**: Focuses on academic material but does not provide comprehensive content for higher education.

:::

### **Key Insight**

Based on this research, we identified an opportunity to develop an application specifically designed to address the needs of Zambian university students.

---

## **Target Audience**

ReviZa is built for Zambian higher education students who need resources tailored to the local university curriculum. This includes students across various disciplines who require reliable and organized academic resources to enhance their learning and revision processes.

---

## **Accomplishments**

- The ReviZa mobile app is fully developed and ready for deployment on the **Google Play Store** and **App Store**.
- Winning the **Zambia@60 Hackathon** secured initial funding, which will help cover the costs associated with the appâ€™s launch.

## **Challenges**

Building ReviZa came with its own set of challenges:

:::caution Ownership and Copyright
To mitigate copyright concerns, access to materials is restricted to students only. This was implemented through a verification system requiring student identification cards.
:::

:::caution Hosting Costs
A platform of this scale requires substantial hosting resources, including Google Cloud storage. Managing these costs remains a challenge as the app scales.
:::

:::caution Securing Investors
Attracting initial investors proved difficult until the Zambia@60 Hackathon, where the project's vision gained recognition and support.

## **Conclusions**

ReviZa has the potential to revolutionize education and the e-learning landscape in Zambia and across Africa. By adopting sustainable business models from the Western world and local competitors, ReviZa offers a unique selling point: an affordable and effective solution tailored to the African market.
