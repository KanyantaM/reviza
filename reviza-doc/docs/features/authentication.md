# Authentication

ReviZa ensures a secure and straightforward authentication process to protect your account and the study materials on our platform.

## Email and Password Login

ReviZa uses **email and password** authentication to provide you with a personalized and secure experience. Here's how it works:

1. **Sign Up**:  
   Create an account with your email address and set a strong password. This ensures only you can access your account.

2. **Log In**:  
   Use your registered email and password to log in to the app or website.

3. **Forgot Password?**  
   If you forget your password, use the "Forgot Password" option to reset it via email.

We are committed to protecting the intellectual property and copyrights of university study materials.  

In the future, **authentication by Student ID** will be introduced. This system will:
