     - **Notes**
     - **Papers**
     - **Books**
     - **Links**
     - **Assignments**
     - **Lab Materials**  
   - This categorization simplifies navigation and ensures efficient retrieval of specific resources.

3. **At-a-Glance Details**  
   - Each material displays critical information, including:
     - Title and description
     - File size
     - Uploading user or contributor
   - A rating bar is also present, encouraging users to interact and evaluate resources.

4. **Integrated Sharing Options**

## How It Works

### Step 1: Select a Course  

From the **Downloads** interface, choose a course to view its associated materials.  

- Courses are displayed in a scrollable list for easy access.

### Step 2: Filter by Material Type  

Refine your view by selecting the type of material. For example:

- If you’re looking for **assignments**, simply tap the **Assignment** option to narrow down the list.

### Step 3: View, Share, or Manage  

Once the materials are displayed, users can:

- **View Details**: Read the description, file size, and contributor’s name.  
- **Download to Device**: Access the file offline for further use.
