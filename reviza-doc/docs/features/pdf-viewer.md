The **PDF Viewer** in ReviZa is a powerful tool designed to enhance your study experience. More than just a viewer, it integrates intelligent features to make accessing and interacting with course materials seamless, insightful, and collaborative.

## Key Features

  - Provides summaries, highlights key sections, and answers questions about the material.
  - Assists with clarifying difficult concepts or locating specific topics within the document.

### 2. **Voting System for Quality Assurance**  

- **Rate Materials**: Users can upvote or downvote the document based on its quality, relevance, and usefulness.  
- **Transparent Ratings**:
  - Each document displays its current rating percentage, making it easy to identify high-quality materials.

### 3. **Reporting System**  

- Found an issue? Use the reporting feature to flag:
  - Plagiarized content.
  - Incomplete or misleading materials.
  - Materials that violate community guidelines.  

Reports are reviewed to maintain a database of only reliable and high-quality resources.

### 4. **Algorithm for Automatic Moderation**  

- **Quality Management**:
  - Materials with consistently low ratings or multiple reports are automatically flagged for review.  
  - Poorly rated or problematic materials are taken down by the algorithm, ensuring users only access top-notch resources.

## Why the PDF Viewer Stands Out

1. **Interactive Study Tool**  
   - With Gemini, you’re not just reading but actively engaging with your material.
   - Ask for explanations, get summaries, or locate important topics with ease.

2. **Collaborative Quality Assurance**  
   - The voting and reporting systems rely on community participation to maintain high standards.
   - Your feedback directly impacts the relevance and quality of the materials available.

3. **Smart Moderation**  
   - The platform’s intelligent algorithm ensures that low-quality materials are removed, allowing you to focus on studying without distractions.
