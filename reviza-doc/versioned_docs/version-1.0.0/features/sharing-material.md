# Uploading Course Materials

The **Upload Material** feature allows students to contribute resources to the ReviZa community. By enabling users to share valuable notes, past papers, and books, the platform fosters a collaborative learning environment. This process ensures materials are organized and structured to maintain high standards and aid discovery by others.

## How It Works

Uploading materials involves a guided process to ensure resources are categorized and well-documented for maximum usability:

### Step 1: Select a Course  

Before uploading, users must select the relevant course.  

- The upload option will only appear once a course is chosen.
- This ensures that all materials are appropriately categorized.

### Step 2: Upload Your File  

Tap the **Select Your File** box and upload your material.  
Accepted file formats include PDFs, Word documents, and images, ensuring diverse content types are supported.

### Step 3: Answer Metadata Questions  

Once the file is uploaded, youâ€™ll be asked a series of questions about the material:  

- **Compulsory Questions**: Required to ensure the material is categorized and searchable.  
- **Optional Questions**: Provide additional details to enhance the resource's quality and usefulness.  

Some examples of metadata questions include:  

- Material Type (Notes, Past Papers, Books, Links)  
- Semester or Academic Year  
- Topic or Keywords
